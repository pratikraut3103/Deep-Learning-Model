# Created CNN Model Using Basic Python Functions

## Project Description
This project involves creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using fundamental Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. The purpose is to manually implement deep learning layers and operationsâ€”including batch normalization, convolution, dropout, flattening, fully connected layers, various weight initializers, pooling layers, and activation functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax, and Tanh. Additionally, the project features implementations of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), loss functions (L1, L2, cross-entropy), and an optimizer (Adam optimizer). The main motivation behind this project is to deepen the understanding of the mechanics behind deep learning models by constructing them from scratch using basic Python functionalities.

## Installation
To get started with this project, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. It is recommended to use Python 3.8 or newer. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
